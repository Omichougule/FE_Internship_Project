SE Internship Project

Topic Description:

The topic deals with various problems and its solution to be delivered using Java programming and providing output based on the desired input given by the user.
Code includes functions like check entered number is even or odd, Count the characters in String and display the count of each letter, reverse the array, calculate area of circle, calculate circumference of circle and find the factorial of the entered number.


Workflow: 

The Approach we are using to solve this problem is by Menu Driven System where we will initially show our menu with various choices like: 
1.	To check if entered number is Even or Odd Number.
2.	To find out the duplicate characters in a String and display the count of them.
3.	To find the reverse of the array.
4.	To calculate area and circumference of circle.
5.	To find the factorial of a number.
6.	Exit.

This will be the menu driven page which will direct the user to the desired option. Further for option : 

1.	Even or odd: User will be asked for a number as input and system will find and display the entered number is even or odd.
2.	Duplicate characters: User will be asked to enter a sentence as input and system will display the count of each letter in the sentence.
3.	Reverse: First the user will be asked to enter how many numbers user wants to enter. And then user will be asked to enter all the numbers giving space. 
        Then system will display the numbers in reverse order.
        For Example: if a user enters the array elements as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 then the program would reverse the array and the elements of the array would be 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
4.	Area and Circumference of Circle: User will be asked to enter radius of a circle and the system will display area and circumference of the circle.
5.	Factorial: User will be asked to enter a number as input and the system will display factorial of the number.
6.	EXIT : If user want to exit from the system.

System will show the menu initially and after completing the task of selected option until user doesnâ€™t want to exit the system.
